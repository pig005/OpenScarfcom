# OpenScarfCom

**Total Conversion Mod** focused on **replayability** for **OpenXcom Extended**

being developped by _greenscarf_ (for now) and released under [gpl v3.0](./OpenScarfCom/LICENSE) [(*)](#submod-credits)

please report any bugs/ideas on `issues`.

## HOW TO INSTALL

OSC needs latest [OXCE](https://openxcom.mod.io/openxcom-extended "link to OXCE mod.io page") to run properly.


1. download OSC on [mod.io](https://openxcom.mod.io/openscarfcom "link to OSC mod.io page")(relatively bug-free) or cloning the repository (nightly, bug-prone)
2. move the repository to My `PC/Documents/OpenXcom/mods`
3. run **latest** OXCE then press `mods`
4. enable OpenScarfCom

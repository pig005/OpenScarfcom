## 2021.04.26 - "Air Day"

### added

- new grenade looks for smoke and frag

- automatic rifle color brightened to match up more with other ballistic tier weapons

### modified

aircraft weapons buff: they were so useless before; now it would stand more chance against ufos and prove some usefulness. to balance, maybe increase cost? to compensate with overall easier dogfight, ufos will also have its buffs, to be added someday...

- missile specs buffed

  - projectile speed **doubled**
  - stingray rate of fire **increased**: **[64, 48, 32] -> [48, 32, 20]**
  - ammo **increased**:
    - avalanche: **3 -> 4**
    - fusion ball: **2 -> 4**

- cannon specs buffed (would come handy for future hunter-killer implementations)

  - damage, rate of fire, firing range, projectile speed **doubled**
  - **_no ammo_ needed**: no chores, more fun!
  - now interceptor's **built-in weapon** (your fightor has **3 weapons pod** total)

- laser cannon buffed

  - range **doubled** (42, the answer to life, universe, and everything)

- arranged armors and weapons into subdirectories (took more time then it seems)

### bugfixes

- annoying error that says `laser tank not on manufacture`
- spritesheet load error (don't use `singlefile` on _spritesheet_))
- also various ones with rifles

## 2021.04.25

- initial release
